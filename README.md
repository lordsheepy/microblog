MICROBLOG
=========

A microblog built in pyramid using the tutorial found here: http://pyramid-blogr.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

---------

Beyond the tuorial, I extended the blog for posts to have owners, and specify
the only owners can edit and delete their posts(delete also added by me). I
swapped sqlite for postgres, and incorporated password hashing.
